# YE_OLDE_ENGLISH_NAME_GEN
 <br/><br/>
## I thought of a cool web app where a person enters their first, or first and last name, and the program will spit out an 'olde english' name for you
 <br/><br/>
## Probably need an input field for the name
 <br/><br/>
## Then maybe an api for a names database? Or maybe some other way to do this
 <br/><br/>
## I'll keep brainstorming!
 <br/><br/>
## I think that if I make a cool like old an wooden english aesthetic
 <br/><br/>
## background for it it would look awesome! Maybe include other period 
 <br/><br/>
## correct images / backgrounds!
